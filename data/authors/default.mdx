### Hello!

I'm Inji Myung, a web front-end developer with a rich tapestry of experiences. My journey began in the intricate world of white-hat hacking, ethically delving into systems to bolster their security. This deep understanding of digital systems transitioned into a passion for front-end development, where I combine security know-how with aesthetic and functional design.

Beyond my professional role, my hobbies extend to app and backend development, allowing me to grasp the full spectrum of the digital creation process. This has enriched my perspective, ensuring a holistic approach to every project.

A particular area of interest for me is the realm of architecture, rendering, and bundle optimization. In a digital age where speed and efficiency are paramount, I'm constantly refining my skills to ensure optimal user experiences without compromising on performance.

My thirst for knowledge is unending. I'm enamored with new technologies, always eager to integrate the latest innovations into my work, ensuring that my projects are both cutting-edge and future-ready.

To sum up, I'm a front-end developer with a hacker's insight, always on the lookout for the next tech evolution. Let's connect and create!

Best,
Inji Myung
