## Warning

```
console.error
      Warning: An update to Counter inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

      When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

      act(() => {
        /* fire events that update state */
      });
      /* assert on the output */

      This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at

          at Counter (C:\Users\windows10\Desktop\code\React\tdd\tdd\src\components\counter\counter.tsx:4:37)

```

## Solution

```sh
yarn upgrade @testing-library/user-event@latest
```
